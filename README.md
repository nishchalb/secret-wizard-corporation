Secret Wizard Corporation
=================

Secret Wizard Corporation is a small prototype game designed and created in two weeks by Nishchal Bhandari, Isaac Rosado, Pravina Saratunga, and Rachel Thornton for the MIT class CMS.611/6.073 Creating Video Games. The game is designed as a flow puzzle game with the addition of magical powers to help when players get stuck. To be successful, players must balance their actions between traditional pipe rotations and magical abilities.

    <td>Date</td>
    <td>Design Change</td> 
    <td>Notes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2/29/16</td>
    <td>Game is something inspired by the term "Secret Wizard Corporation"</td> 
    <td>We otherwise have no clue what the game will be about. We don't even know what engine we'll be using.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3/1/16</td>
    <td>Making game a pipe puzzle, getting from start to end of the puzzle. Players will have to use (unimplemented) magic powers to solve the puzzle.</td> 
    <td>Game is paper prototyped, without the powers in play.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3/2/16</td>
    <td>Implemented randomized level generation. Can check if puzzle is solved.</td> 
    <td>We still don't know what the powers will be. Why would the players even use them at all?</td>
  </tr> 
  <tr>
    <td>3/4/16</td>
    <td>Added money counter to provide players with a source of in-game pressure.</td> 
    <td>Will this be any fun? Still brainstorming powers.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3/7/16</td>
    <td>Added buttons that cast magic powers. Players can change tiles into two different types, give themselves more money, and change the direction of a single click. Also, added end states for the game.</td> 
    <td>The penalties for using these powers should be balanced against the money.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>3/9/16</td>
    <td>First focus test session. See focustest1.rtf for more details. Lots of balance changes due to playtests.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3/11/16</td>
    <td>Added aesthetic touches such as backgrounds and sound effects.</td>
