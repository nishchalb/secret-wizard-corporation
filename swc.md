Secret Wizard Corporation
=================

Secret Wizard Corporation is a small prototype game designed and created in two weeks by Nishchal Bhandari, Isaac Rosado, Pravina Saratunga, and Rachel Thornton for the MIT class CMS.611/6.073 Creating Video Games. The game is designed as a flow puzzle game with the addition of magical powers to help when players get stuck. To be successful, players must balance their actions between traditional pipe rotations and magical abilities.
